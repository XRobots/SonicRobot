Code and CAD for my two-wheel balancing robot:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpwJoq86vov_tZ3rsMCH5sylqGT5s9TcU

Main parts in the robot are (more details in part 2 of the video series).

-Teensy 3.6 for the main processor.

-MPU6050 on a GY521 style breakout.

-2x Teensy 3.2 to read the load cells in the legs.

-2x 20Kg Loadcells.

-2x Sparkfun Qwiic Scales: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15242 .

-'SN65HVD230 CAN BusBoard Network Transceiver Module compatible with PCA82C250' CAN Bus Transceivers.

-2x ODrive 3.6 56V version.

-2x 150Kv 6374 ODrive branded brushless motors.

-2x Turnigy SK3 6374 149Kv brushless motors.

-4x 8192 CPR encoders also available from ODrive.

-Some switches etc to initialise the Odrives and an Estop which brings the ODrive RST pins to ground.

-NRF24L01 Rf device.

-Varios proto board.


Main parts in the remote are:

-Arduino MEGA2650.

-Another NRF24L01 RF device.

-some switches, and some 3-axis joysticks I got from eBay.


Other mechanical parts (check part 1 for  more details):

-2x Wheel drive belts - 450mm AT5 belts.

-2x Wheel drive motor pulleys - 14 tooth AT5 aluminium pulleys, 8mm bore to match the motors.

-2x 200mm SFU1605 ball screws

-2x 10mm-10mm CNC couplers

-8x CNC style V-Wheels, 5mm ID bearings, plus nuts and bolts.

-4x M10/10mm Rose joints.

-A bunch of 2040 and 2020 Vslot extrusion - refer to the CAD and video.

-Misc T-nuts and M4 bolts of various lengths.

-8x 12mm ID / 32mm OD / 10mm thick bearings for hip joints.

-8x 8mm ID / 22mm OD / 7mm thick bearings for knee joints.

-Various lengths of M12 and M10 studding plus washers and nuts to suit.


Other details:

-I'm running it off 2x 6S 5000 mAH LiPo packs in series

-Electronics are on a separate 5v regulator running from a separate 11.1v LiPo battery.

-Put 0.1uF decoupling capacitors on everything.


Main Library Dependencies are:

For Teensy CAN: https://github.com/tonton81/IFCT

For the MPU 6050: https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib

For the load cells: https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Scale_NAU7802_Arduino_Library/

For the ODrvies: https://github.com/madcowswe/ODrive/tree/master/Arduino/ODriveArduino

Plus RF24 library from the Arduino libraries manager, other built in libraries

Use the IMUzero example included with the MPU6050 to read the IMU calibration setting and put those into your sketch: https://github.com/jrowberg/i2cdevlib/tree/master/Arduino/MPU6050/examples/IMU_Zero
